Hi,

during a test with piuparts I noticed your package left unowned files on
the system after purge, which is a violation of policy 6.8:

From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):


As putting files into /usr/local is also a violation of
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#site-specific-programs
I'm setting the severity to serious.


cheers,
