Subject: copyright file missing after upgrade (policy 12.5)

Hi,

a test with piuparts revealed that your package misses the copyright
file after an upgrade, which is a violation of Policy 12.5:
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs.html#copyright-information

After the upgrade /usr/share/doc/$PACKAGE/ is just an empty directory.

This was observed on the following upgrade paths:


From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):



Additional info may be available here:
https://wiki.debian.org/MissingCopyrightFile

Note that dpkg intentionally does not replace directories with symlinks
and vice versa, you need the maintainer scripts to do this.
See in particular the end of point 4 in
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#details-of-unpack-phase-of-installation-or-upgrade

It is recommended to use the dpkg-maintscript-helper commands
'dir_to_symlink' and 'symlink_to_dir' (available since dpkg 1.17.14)
to perform the conversion, ideally using d/$PACKAGE.maintscript.
Do not forget to add 'Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}' in d/control.
See dpkg-maintscript-helper(1) and dh_installdeb(1) for details.


cheers,
