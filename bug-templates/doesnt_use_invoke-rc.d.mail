Hi,

during a test with piuparts I noticed your package starts processes
where it shouldn't. This is very probably due to not using invoke-rc.d
as mandated by policy 9.3.3.2. This is seriously disturbing! ;-)

See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#interfacing-with-init-systems
and /usr/share/doc/sysv-rc/README.invoke-rc.d.gz as well
as /usr/share/doc/sysv-rc/README.policy-rc.d.gz

From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):



cheers,
