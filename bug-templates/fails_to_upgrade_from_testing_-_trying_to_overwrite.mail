Subject: fails to upgrade from 'testing' - trying to overwrite ...

Package:
Version:
Severity: serious
User: debian-qa@lists.debian.org
Usertags: piuparts

Hi,

during a test with piuparts I noticed your package fails to upgrade from
'testing'.
It installed fine in 'testing', then the upgrade to 'sid' fails
because it tries to overwrite other packages files without declaring a
Breaks+Replaces relation.

See policy 7.6 at
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#overwriting-files-and-replacing-packages-replaces

From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):


cheers,
