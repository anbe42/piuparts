Subject: fails to upgrade from 'stable' to 'sid' - trying to overwrite ...

Hi,

during a test with piuparts I noticed your package fails to upgrade from
'stable'.
It installed fine in 'stable', then the upgrade to 'sid' fails
because it tries to overwrite other packages files without declaring a
Breaks+Replaces relation.

See policy 7.6 at
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#overwriting-files-and-replacing-packages-replaces

This test intentionally skipped 'testing' to find file overwrite
problems before packages migrate from 'unstable' to 'testing'.

From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):


cheers,
