Hi,

during a test with piuparts I noticed your package left unowned files on
the system after purge, which is a violation of policy 6.8 (or 10.8):

https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-maintainerscripts.html#details-of-removal-and-or-configuration-purging

Filing this as important as having a piuparts clean archive is a release
goal since lenny.

From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):



cheers,
