Subject: prompts user without following Debian Configuration Management Specification

Version:
Severity: serious

Hi,

during a test with piuparts I noticed your package prompts the user
badly.  Prompting in maintainer scripts must be done by communicating
through a program such as debconf which conforms to the Debian
Configuration Management Specification, version 2 or higher.

Refer to Debian Policy Manual section 3.9.1 (Prompting in maintainer
scripts) for details. Quoting from
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html#prompting-in-maintainer-scripts

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ 3.9.1 Prompting in maintainer scripts ]
Package maintainer scripts may prompt the user if necessary. Prompting
must be done by communicating through a program, such as debconf, which
conforms to the Debian Configuration Management Specification, version 2
or higher.

Packages which are essential, or which are dependencies of essential
packages, may fall back on another prompting method if no such interface
is available when they are executed.

The Debian Configuration Management Specification is included in the
debconf_specification files in the debian-policy package.

From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):



And as it's not possible to set two usertags at the same time, this also
should to be done:

User: lintian-maint@debian.org
Usertags: read-in-maintainer-script

cheers,
