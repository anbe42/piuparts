Subject: postinst uses /usr/share/doc content (Policy 12.3):

Package:
Version:
Severity: serious

Hi,

a test with piuparts revealed that your package uses files from
/usr/share/doc in its maintainer scripts which is a violation of
Policy 12.3: "Packages must not require the existence of any files in
/usr/share/doc/ in order to function."
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs.html#additional-documentation

These files must be moved to /usr/share/$PACKAGE and may be symlinked
from /usr/share/doc/$PACKAGE.

This piuparts test prevents the installation of (most) files into
/usr/share/doc with 'dpkg --path-exclude=...'.

From the attached log (scroll to the bottom...):



Cheers,
