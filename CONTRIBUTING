Contributing code to this project
---------------------------------

It's helpful to track fixes or new features via wishlist bugs against the
'piuparts' package, eg with the 'reportbug' tool ('devscripts' package).
The BTS will ensure the developers' mailing list
   piuparts-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net
is notified.

Patches can be submitted by mail (git format-patch, see below)
or as requests to pull from a publicly-visible git repository.
In either case, please make a topic branch based on the 'develop' branch.

You can send patches or requests to the development list,
or to the tracking bug: <bugnumber>@bugs.debian.org.

One possible workflow:
  git clone https://salsa.debian.org/debian/piuparts.git
  git checkout origin/develop -b <topicname>
  <edits>
  git commit -a
  git format-patch -M origin/develop

  reportbug piuparts
  <describe the issue, attach the patch>

Contributing bugs to other projects
-----------------------------------
Another very useful type of contributions are filing bug reports based
on piuparts runs. This is described in https://piuparts.debian.org/bug_howto.html
